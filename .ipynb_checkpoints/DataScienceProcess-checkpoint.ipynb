    "# Data Science process from Start to Finish\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started my data science journey, I was in for a rude awakening. I dove neck deep into heavy statistics, learning new computing languages, and detailed data science process. One of the things I wished I learned at the very beginning is, a combination of the Data science process using a dataset example. That is exactly what I plan on doing in this blog. I’ll be providing what a general learner data science notebook will look like with examples. The dataset I’m using is the Northwind database. Which is a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s good practice to know your which method, workflow, and/or process you plan on using.Today, I’ll be using a combination of  the OSEMiN method which stands for, Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret, and the Scientific method (like in grade school, testing your hypothesis, ect.). The OSEMiN method is one to the most common/popular method used in the data science workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the OSEMN and Scientific method is used for the framework of this project. Starting with retrieving and cleaning our data to avoid errors down the process. Then, exploring the data to get a \"feel\" of what we're looking at intuitively, using visualizations and calling methods to provide insight about our data. Many iterations will be made in going back and forth between wrangling and exploring our data to prepare the data for modeling. After our data is polished and clean, we proceed to feeding it into our model/algorithm. We then build and tweak models accordingly, in order to get the best results. Lastly, we interpret the results the best possible in order to either answer the questions provided or further the analysis is done, to provide a conclusion and or insight about new findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define question \n",
    "2. Exploratory research \n",
    "    - Explore data \n",
    "3. Define hypothesis \n",
    "    - Define null and alternative hypothesis\n",
    "    - Choose between using a one-tailed test (directional) or a two-tailed test (non-directional)\n",
    "    - Set significance level $\\alpha$ (alpha) - commonly set at 0.05\n",
    "4. Statistical tests\n",
    "    - Rationalize the appropriate statistical test\n",
    "    - Checking assumptions \n",
    "    - Calculating test statistic and p-value \n",
    "    - Calculating effect size \n",
    "5. Conclusion(s)\n",
    "    - Interpret outcome\n",

    "After obtaining our data, I separated the data into two dataframes, performed analysis of the number of  products purchased with/without discount and visualized the sum and mean of the data. I visually checked for normality using Q-Q plot and statistically, using SciPy's normaltest. After concluding that our data is not normal, I will use tests that performs well with non normal data. Parametric tests will be performed because parametric tests can perform well with continuous data that aren't normally distributed, **if** you satisfy the sample size in the guidelines [here](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/choosing-between-a-nonparametric-test-and-a-parametric-test) (1-sample t test, Greater than 20, ect.).

    "The test results showed that discounts above has a **statistical significance** on the number of products customers order vs. orders without discount.
